## Complexity

### Runtime, Memory

Just use asymptotic complexity to measure the complexity of the code, and present in big O notation. \
This measurement can be used in both time (Runtime) and space (Memory).

### Reliability

> Runtime < Memory

Runtime will depend on the LeetCode servers' current load not just on the time complexity of the code. \
Therefore, it may get different results on runtime complexity or memory complexity while running same code.
